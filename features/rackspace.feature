Feature: provisioning a node on Rackspace
  In order to run my puppet code on a new Rackspace machine
  As someone who wants to deploy something to the machine
  I want to run the provision command

@announce-stdout
@announce-stderr
Scenario: config in local file
  Given I have puppet code in "/tmp/skewer_test_code"
  And a file named ".skewer.json" with:
"""
{
  "puppet_repo":"/tmp/skewer_test_code",
  "flavor_id":"1",
  "image_id":"112"
}
"""
  When I run `./bin/skewer provision --cloud rackspace --role foobar --image 112`
  Then the stdout should contain "Evaluating cloud rackspace"
  And the stdout should contain "Launching a Rackspace node"
